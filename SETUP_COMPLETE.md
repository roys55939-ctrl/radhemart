## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If "Sync Data" shows success but no data:
1. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
2. Verify the refund form submission completed successfully
3. Try the "Debug Refresh" button (red button in admin panel)
4. Check your Gist directly: https://gist.github.com/roys55939-ctrl/ae529d0b20327653cb7ccbc2bced58be
